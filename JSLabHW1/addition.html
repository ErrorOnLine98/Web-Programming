	<!-- The only mistake with the code was that the prompts would 
	output as strings instead of numbers, so when written onto the page 
	they were concatenated as strings. Thus, 2 + 2 would result in 22 
	instead of 4. I used parseFloat instead of parseInt so that the 
	program would be able to add decimal numbers as well for added 
	functionality. Also, <!DOCTYPE html> and <meta charset="utf-8"> were 
	added, but their absence in the original code was not the cause of 
	the issue. -->
