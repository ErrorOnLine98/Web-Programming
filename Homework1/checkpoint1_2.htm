<h3>Describe the components of the client/server model as applied to the Internet.</h3>
The client is the computer program that requests some kind of service from the server, and the server fulfills that request and transmits the the results to the client over a network. Also, most servers can handle requests from multiple clients.
<h3>Identify two protocols used on the Internet to convey information that use the Internet but do not use the Web.</h3>
<ul>
<li>File Transfer Protocol</li>
<li>Transmission Control Protocol</li>
</ul>
<h3>Explain the similarities and differences between a URL and a domain name.</h3>
A URL represents the network location of resource. It consists of the protocol, domain name, and the hierarchical location of the file on the web server. A domain name locates an organization or entity on the internet. A domain name is contained within the URL and helps determine the network location of a resource such as a webpage.
